- this is a POC app for MVVM practice
- This project uses retrofit, okhttp, androidx, room, livedata, view model, picasso, picasso, gson, laterial lib

**Note** To build the app please add open weather map api key here: in `local.properties` in root folder like `OWM_STAGE_API_KEY=this12344is2355my3333key`. Or modify code to supply appid to call interceptor (by hardcoding it right there), or can be added in app gradle as well

todo: dark mode, ui changes to make it not look ugly, ~~change branch name to "main"~~, possibly few more screens (i.e. forecast via onecall or owm's dedicatd forecast api), some fancy views like collapsible etc
